This app provides an HTTP API for creating, maintaining and reading articles.

An article is an [RDF graph], where the root node is a [`http://schema.org/Article`][schema:Article]. We can encode an
article in [JSON-LD]: 

```json
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@id": "http://example.com/my-article-store/articles/1234567890",
  "@type": "Article",
  "name": "My article"
}
```

The API uses the [Hydra vocabulary] as its [hypermedia format][HATEOAS], and follows the [Libero API specification].

It's written in [TypeScript], uses the [Koa framework][Koa], and various [RDF/JS libraries][RDF/JS].

The app persists articles in a [PostgreSQL] database.

Installation
------------

You can find the app on Docker Hub: [`liberoadmin/article-store`][Docker image].

As it is still under heavy development, there are not yet tagged releases. However, an image is available for every
commit.

### Running an Article Store

1. Start a PostgreSQL container by executing:

   ```shell
   docker run -d --name article-store-database \
     -e "POSTGRES_DB=article-store" \
     -e "POSTGRES_USER=user" \
     postgres:11.5-alpine
   ```

2. Run the database creation with an ephemeral Article Store container:

   ```shell
   docker run --rm \
     --link article-store-database \
     -e "DATABASE_HOST=article-store-database" \
     -e "DATABASE_NAME=article-store" \
     -e "DATABASE_USER=user" \
     liberoadmin/article-store:latest npm run initdb
   ```

3. Run an Article Store container and link it to the database container:

   ```shell
   docker run \
     --link article-store-database \
     -e "DATABASE_HOST=article-store-database" \
     -e "DATABASE_NAME=article-store" \
     -e "DATABASE_USER=user" \
     -p 8080:8080 \
     liberoadmin/article-store:latest
   ```

4. Access the Article Store entry point:

   ```shell
   curl --verbose localhost:8080
   ```

### Configuration

The following environment variables can be set:

#### `DATABASE_HOST`

This variable is mandatory is the PostgreSQL hostname.

#### `DATABASE_NAME`

This variable is mandatory and is the name of the PostgreSQL database.

#### `DATABASE_USER`

This variable is mandatory and is the name of the PostgreSQL user.

#### `DATABASE_PASSWORD`

This variable is optional and is the password of the PostgreSQL user (default is blank).

#### `DATABASE_PORT`

This variable is optional and is the PostgreSQL port (default `5432`).

Development
-----------

<details>

<summary>Requirements</summary>

- [Docker]
- [GNU Bash]
- [GNU Make]
- [Node.js]

</details>

The project contains a [Makefile] which uses [Docker Compose] for development and testing.

You can find the possible commands by executing:

```shell
make help
```

### Running the app

To build and run the app for development, execute:

```shell
make dev
```

You can now access the entry point at <http://localhost:8080>, or view the console at <http://localhost:8081>.

<details>

<summary>Rebuilding the container</summary>

Code is attached to the containers as volumes so most updates are visible without a need to rebuild the container.
However, changes to NPM dependencies, for example, require a rebuild. So you may need to execute

```shell
make build
```

before running further commands.

</details>

### Running the tests

We use [Jest] to test the app. You can run it by executing: 

```shell
make test
```

You can also run the tests in separate suites:

```shell
make unit-test
make integration-test
```

Integration tests have a `@group integration` annotation, and can access a PostgreSQL instance. 

### Linting

We lint the app with [ESLint]. You can run it by:

```shell
make lint
```

Problems can be automatically fixed, where possible, by executing:

```shell
make fix
```
