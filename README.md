This app provides a hypermedia API for storing articles ().

An article is an RDF graph, where the root node is a [`http://schema.org/Article`][schema:Article].

It uses the [Hydra vocabulary], and follows the [Libero API specification].

It's written in [TypeScript], uses the [Koa framework][Koa], and various
[RDF/JS libraries][RDF/JS].

üìô Installation
---------------

The app is published on Docker Hub as [`liberoadmin/article-store`][Docker image].

As it is still under heavy development, there are not yet tagged releases. However, an image is available for every
commit.

<details>

<summary>Configuration</summary>

It requires the following environment variables when run:

| Name                | Description                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_HOST`     | PostgreSQL hostname, e.g. example.com |
| `DATABASE_NAME`     | Name of the database                  |
| `DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Password for the user                 |
| `DATABASE_PORT`     | PostgreSQL port, e.g. 5432            |
| `DATABASE_USER`     | PostgreSQL username                   |

Port `8080` is exposed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Docker Compose example</summary>

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: liberoadmin/article-store:latest
    environment:
      DATABASE_NAME: article-store
      DATABASE_USER: user
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: secret
      DATABASE_HOST: example.com
      DATABASE_PORT: 5432
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
```

</details>

‚öíÔ∏è Local usage
--------------

<details>

<summary>Requirements</summary>

- [Docker]
- [GNU Bash]
- [GNU Make]
- [Node.js]

</details>

To build and run the app for development, execute:

```shell
make dev
```

You can now access the entry point at <http://localhost:8080>, or view the console at <http://localhost:8081>.

<details>

<summary>Rebuilding the container</summary>

Code is attached to the containers as volumes so most updates are visible without a need to rebuild the container.
However, changes to NPM dependencies, for example, require a rebuild. So you may need to execute

```shell
make build
```

before running further commands.

</details>

### Running the tests

The app is tested using [Jest]. It can be run by executing: 

```shell
make test
```

The tests can also be run in separate suites:

```shell
make unit-test
make integration-test
```

Integration tests are separated using the `@group integration` annotation, and can access a PostgreSQL instance. 

### Linting

The app is linted using [ESLint]. It can be run by executing:

```shell
make lint
```

Problems can be automatically fix, where possible, by executing:

```shell
make fix
```
